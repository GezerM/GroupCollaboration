Dear all 
This is an experimental issue
so please make your changes here and push them to the group and see how this will work!

In this exercise you are kindly expected to make changes on the document, such as adding two keywords to your questions and push it back. So will give soft try how we work on one single document. Currently it will be a straight text message, but in the near future we will try to collaborate on a Java code as well. 
Obviously this is not the best practice but it is only the first practice for all of us.
By the way thank you for your cooperation in advance.


Dear @everyone, 
We are going to have our regular group meeting on Monday. In order to get the most of it, I have assigned some questions, from the document that was share by Omer, to each of you. I did try to follow the order of questions but skipped some for a number of reasons. 
Here are the rules of engagement. 
1.    We will have in total three loops. I will go person by person, one question at a time. 
2.    Each of you will try to do what we do for a Flipgrid recording.
3.    But each of you will have only one minute each question and any question whether long or short. So please tailor your response accordingly. (I might consider to do something other for longer answers later, but for the first round I am looking for a light touch and go to each and every question on the document). 
4.    Please at the start of your response try give us two keywords that we should remember regarding that question. 
At the end of the meeting we will have a short retro session to decide on what we should keep doing and what we should fix. 
So if you have any questions, feel free to throw them in. And please try to be happy what you have as a question, since life itself might not be no more just than this.
